This fixes some issues related to syncing of onchain transaction history that could cause a broken state that would then break all further onchain transactions and channel openings since the wallet would try to spend outputs that were already spent.

It improves handling of connections to Electrum servers such that the wallet is more resilient, specially over Tor.

It updates the bundled channel graph file to make the initial channels sync process much faster.
